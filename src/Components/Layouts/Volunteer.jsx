        <p className='card-text'>Monetary donations are always much needed and vary much appreciated, as are direct donations to our Veterinary partners which helps reduce the every present balance we maintain with them! Gift Cards to Pet Supply stores such as Petco or PetSmart are helpful as well. If you are interested in donating directly to our Shelter Renovation fund "Save the Tails" you may find donation information and options here. In addition to monetary donations, we have a wish list of needed items.. see below or NOW you can go directly to our Amazon Wish List!</p>

        <p className='card-text'>pet Rescue by Judy very much appreciates your donations! At this time, the items listed above are needed for our facility. We are grateful for the support of our community and thank you so much for thinking of us!</p>
        <p className='card-text'>Donations, both big and small, are always welcome and appreciated. In Addition to our operating expenses, we also have expenses associated with the care of the pets. All of our pets need to be spayed/neutered, microchipped, brought up to date on shots, and treated for medical needs. Unfortunately, many times we also encounter unexpected medical expenses for many of our rescues. Although we have very supportive veterinarians, they cannot completely waive their fees.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>Please help us if you can. You can make a one-time donation or choose to sponsor a specific pet. Perhaps you would consider committing to covering the cost of spaying/neutering one pet a month! When we know we can count on a force of people standing with us, what a difference we can make! Donations can be made through our Paypal account or by mailing a check. We are forever grateful for those who help us help them!</p>
        <p className='card-text'>Your donations are tax deductible. All monies go directly to the care of the animals. Consider this: many large corporations have programs matching donations to nonprofit organizations. Ask your human resouce department. Make donations payable to:</p>
