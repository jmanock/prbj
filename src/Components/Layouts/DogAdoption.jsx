        <p className='card-text'>Pet Rescue By Judy is a non-profit, no-kill organization. The PRBJ adoption-donation fee collected is used to cover total cost of medical care, food, deworming, etc. of all pets at PRBJ. As we have a variety of animals in our care with a wide range of medical needs, all donations collected are utilized towards all expenses within the resuce.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>The goal of PRBJ is not just to place every animal into a home, but it is to place each animal into the RIGHT home, seeking that forever home, to avoid future transition and negative impact on the life of each of these deserving animals.</p>
