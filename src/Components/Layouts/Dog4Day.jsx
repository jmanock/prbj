        <p className='card-text'>With Dog 4 a Day, you have the opportunity to spend a fun-filled day with our pooches by taking them our of their kennels and going on an outing of your choice. Some great things to do with you dog for the day are: taking walks, going for car rides, playing with toys, getting a special treat, snuggling with your pooch, and having a great time knowing you're giving your friendly new pal a day outside of the shelter! Please be aware some specific dogs have specific needs, and not all are available for this program; we also ask that you do NOT take them to dog parks on your outing</p>
