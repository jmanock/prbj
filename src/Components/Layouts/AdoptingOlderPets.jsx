        <p className='card-text'>"I want a puppy! I want a kitty!" We hear this daily. Everyone loves a cute, clumsy puppy and a soft, warm kitten. But we also know that puppies aren't housetrained, they chew, they jump, they demand activity and can become destructive when bored. Kittens are nocturnal, often keeping their owners up at night while they play and scratch every piece of furniture in sight. Many adopters do not expect the time committment and responsibilities involved in adopting a younger pet. This is why we try to encourage the adoption of our adult pets, and offer a program to seniors who are willing to adopt one of our seniors! When you adopt an adult pet they are usually more mellow and fully grown. As one of our fosters recently said after fostering an 11-year-old Terrier, "I have learned more from her than from any other dog I have every owned." There is something truly special about rescuing a senior pet... It is a gratitude and a depth of relationship that it is hard to describe. </p>

        <h5 className='card-title'>Top 10 Reasons for Adopting a Senior</h5>
        <ol className='list-group list-group-flush'>
          <li className='list-group-item'>When a senior cat or dog is adopted, they seem to appreciate and understand that they have been rescued and given another life in their new family... and they are all the more thankful for it.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>They're already housetrained or litter trained. You won't have to go through the difficult (and often frustrating) stage of teching a puppy or kitten their bathroom manners and mopping/cleaning up after accidents.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>What you see is what you get. Unlike puppies and kittens, a senior pet's personality has already developed so you will know if he or she is a good fit for your family. They are also already fully grown.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>They let you get a good night's sleep because they're accustomed to human schedules, more mellow, and don't need nighttime feedings, comforting or bathroom breaks.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>They've already grown out of the teething/chewing or scratching phase and won't chew your shoes or scratch your furniture when you're not looking.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>Training a senior pet is much easier because they're more focused and less distracted.  Therefore, they learn quickly. Who says you can't teach an old dog or cat new tricks??</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>They have already learned what "No" means and they have the maturity to understand impulse control.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>Senior pets settle into a new environment more easily because they've learned what it takes to get along with others and become part of a pack.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>They are instant companions. Senior pets are often content to just relax in your company or ready for any adventure with you.</li>
          <li className='list-group-item'>They leave you with plenty of time for yourself because they don't make the same demands for your time and attention that puppies and kittens do.</li>
