        <h5 className='card-title'>PRBJ Foster Program FAQ & More</h5>
        <p className='card-text'>Every day Judy and her staff get numerous phone calls from people asking for help in rescuing a cat or dog. Her ability to respond is dependent upon the number of foster homes and the spaces at our Sanford center that are available. Fostering is an opportunity to save a life of a beloved dog or cat. Many of our foster families say that fostering is like pet-sitting; you are welcoming one of our animals into your home until he/she is adopted. One great perk of fostering is that we take care of everything: this program is FREE, and we simply ask you to provide the love and affection. By filling out our Foster Care Application, you let us know the type, size, and age of animal that you can care for. Easy, fun, free, and fulfilling! Want to become a foster parent? Please fill our Foster Care Application.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>*As a potential individual or family wanting to foster, you may have a few questions. Kindly see below for important FAQ's and overall important information:</p>

        <h5 className='card-title'>What should I consider before filling out a Foster Application online?</h5>
        <p className='card-text'>Fostering is fun, but there are a few things to keep in mind before going through with your application: MANY apartments require pet fees/deposits in order to have a pet on-site in your home; there also may be breed or weight restrictions depending on your dwelling, so make sure to check with management before considering to foster.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>Puppies under 6 months of age CAN NOT be fostered, and kittens available for adoption (typically 2-3 months old) are not up to be fostered because they have a better chance to be adopted for our shelter location. *Under special review, it may be possible to foster puppy and kitten litters, including those animals who need to be bottle fed*</p>
        <p className='card-text'>Please consider fostering older dogs or cats, as they tend to shut down in a shelter environment and become very stressed!</p>
        <p className='card-text'>Fostering an animal is hard work! It involves 24/7 care, and we prefer experienced animal lovers to embrace the job.</p>

        <h5 className='card-title'>Why would I want to be a foster?</h5>
        <p className='card-text'>The biggest reason for someone wanting to be a foster is because it is an opportunity to save a life! You help ensure that the animal does not need to be rescued again by being an intrical part in helping us understand the animal's needs, thus making it easier to place them in the perfect forever home.</p>

        <h5 className='card-title'>How much will fostering cost?</h5>
        <p className='card-text'>It's FREE! As a foster home, we do not expect you to incur any cost - we will provide the food and medical care. We simply ask you to provide the love.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>You will be provided with a crate, food and/or litter. Crates are on loan for the duration of fostering. You may pick up these necessities from the Sanford Adoption Center, or you may purchase it on your own as a donation toward their care.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>ALL of our animals must be fed a high-quality diet with limited ingredients.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>DO NOT: change the food of your foster pet.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>Contact your Foster Coordination if you believe your pet needs medical attention/grooming. We have professional relationships with providers who give quality care at a discount. We also maintain a stock of common medications to keep our expenses down. Should you choose to provide your own grooming or medical care, all paperwork must be turned in with the pet or you will not be reimbursed.</p>

        <h5 className='card-title'>What might be some of my responsibilities be while fostering?</h5>
        <p className='card-text'>DO: Pets must be given flea/tick and heartworm preventive on the first of every month (these are provided at our Sanford Adoption Center or you may wish to purchase it on your own as a donation toward their care.) Any other medications will be given to you when you take home your foster pet. If a medication needs to be refilled, contact our office ASAP.</p>

        <h5 className='card-title'>What type of animal will I foster?</h5>
        <p className='card-text'>By filling out our Foster Care Application, you let us know the type of animal you can care for (type, size, and age), as well as the time commitment you are comfortable with.</p>

        <h5 className='card-title'>How could I bear to give up the pet once I've fostered?</h5>
        <p className='card-text'>Many of our foster families say that they consider fostering like they consider pet-sitting. An example we like to use is: think about if your were to go on vacation and ask me to take care of your dog for you; I would enjoy doing so, but I would also be a little sad when you came to pick up your pet. However, I would know that they were going back to a home where they were safe and loved. The difference in fostering is that you can welcome another animal into my home again right away.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>DO: while fostering, email foster@petrescuebyjudy.com with an update on your pet. Review your foster pet's webpage for accuracy; share with us any observations, behaviors, training, etc. that we can add to the pet's page to make it more detailed and improve the chances of adoption. A good photo is often the most important feature on an animail's web page. Please send us updated photos so we can put them on their webpage--we may also feature your foster pet on our Facebook Page. You may email info@petrescuebyjudy.com for your foster pet to be featured on Facebook, but please send regular photo updates to our foster coordinator.</p>

        <p className='card-text'>DO NOT: give your foster pet to anyome. The pet is to remain under your care or be brought back to PRBJ. If you go on vacation or need to leave suddenly, please contact us to return your foster pet. You may be able to pick up your foster pet once you return.</p>
        <p className='card-text'>DO NOT: if someone you know is interested in adopting, they must fill out an adoption application online. Schedule your own adoption meets.
